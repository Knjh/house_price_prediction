# House Price Prediction Project

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models trained on the **Ames Housing Dataset**. The dataset contains detailed information about houses, including their size, quality, and location, making it ideal for regression-based price predictions.


## 🔍 Data Processing & Feature Engineering
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and removed unnecessary columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features like `TotalSF`, `TotalBathrooms`.
- **Data Visualization:** Used Seaborn & Matplotlib for exploratory analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identified key features impacting house prices.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
We implemented multiple regression models and evaluated their performance:
1. **Lasso Regression** 🏹
2. **Ridge Regression** 🏔️
3. **XGBoost Regressor** 🚀

Evaluation metrics used:
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
